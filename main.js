It's National Sweet Day at School of Code, where Chris is kind enough to bring in a variety of sweets for the hard working bootcampers. Chris could bring in any number of sweets depending on how well we've done so far. For instance, he could bring in 5 of one type, 12 of another type, 36 of another type, etc. 

Write a function called sweetsFromChris to see if the sweets are divisible by the amount of bootcampers, so that everyone gets an even amount of sugar! An array of sweet amounts and a number of bootcampers will be provided. If all the bootcampers get the same amount of sweets, a message should return 'Happy days!! Thanks Chris!'. If some bootcampers get less sweets than others, return a message saying 'Aw man! That's not fair!'

//ðŸ‘‰ Write the function your CodeWarriors will start with below here:
function sweetsFromChris() {
    let numberOfSweets =




};

module.exports = { sweetsFromChris };
